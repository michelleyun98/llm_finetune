# Fine-tuning GPT on therapy data

Receiving support for mood disorders, anxiety, ADHD, and other mental health disorders can be a daunting task. In BC, where 26% of residents donâ€™t have a family doctor, access to treatment is additionally hindered by a lack of pre-existing medical records and lengthy gaps between appointments. Even after a first appointment with a general practitioner, BC patients face a median wait of 33.3 weeks before they begin receiving treatment. Given these limitations, the initial screening process - a short form, typically completed online - is a valuable tool for physicians who need to quickly identify and allocate appropriate treatments. While never intended as a diagnostic tool or replacement for an in-person appointment, pre-existing screening tools are simply checklists. Patients cannot ask for clarification on terminology, a problem typically faced by recent immigrants; furthermore, users in immediate emotional distress do not receive any immediate validation or reassurance.
